# Flow — Simulating the CSRF and DoS Attacks

> **After the security fix (12 November 2026):** the vulnerable behavior below describes
> the original baseline. Automated replays now reject the forged form with **403** without
> inserting a request, and throttle the flood with **429**. All maintenance
> endpoints share a limit of **30 requests per client IP per minute**. Valid writes still
> work when the client fetches `/api/csrf-token` and echoes it in `x-csrf-token`.
> `npm test` now passes the **6 original tests across 3 suites**. See
> [verification and the startup-configuration findings](docs/security-report.md).

This project ships a **deliberately vulnerable** feature: **Maintenance Requests**
(`/maintenance`). Any logged-in resident can file a request to fix something in a room.
Two things are wrong with it:

1. **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery).** The app authenticates every request with a
   **JWT stored in an httpOnly cookie**. The browser attaches that cookie **automatically**
   to *every* request to the API — including requests triggered by a completely different
   website. So an attacker's page can forge a state-changing request **in the victim's name**
   without ever seeing their password or token.
2. **DoS (Denial of Service).** There is **no rate limiting** anywhere, so a single client
   can flood the endpoints with unlimited requests and exhaust the server.

Follow the steps to reproduce both, then read *Why it works*, then run the tests.

## 0. Prerequisites & setup

From the **project root** (`Task-5.4/`):

```bash
npm install          # installs server + client (npm workspaces) + test tooling
```

Create `server/.env` (if missing):

```
PORT=4000
MONGO_URI=<your MongoDB connection string>
JWT_SECRET=<any long random string>
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d
```

Start the app:

```bash
npm run dev          # API on http://localhost:4000, client on http://localhost:5175
```

Open the client at **http://localhost:5175**.

---

## 1. Become the victim

1. Click **Register** and create a user (e.g. `victim@test.dev` / `secret123`).
2. You are now logged in. Open DevTools → **Application → Cookies → http://localhost:4000**
   and note the `token` cookie. It is **HttpOnly** (JavaScript cannot read it) — but the
   browser still sends it on every request to the API.
3. Click **Maintenance** and file a request (e.g. room `B2-104`, *plumbing*, "Leaking tap").
   This is a legitimate action; the forged one is about to look just like it.

**Leave this browser logged in.** Both attacks rely on the victim's active session.

---

## 2. Run the attacker site

The `attacker/` folder is a tiny, separate Express server that plays the role of "some random
site the victim visits" (a phishing link, a forum post, an ad iframe…).

In a **second terminal**:

```bash
cd attacker
npm install
npm start            # Attacker site on http://localhost:1337
```

---

## 3. Spring the CSRF trap

In the **same browser** where you are logged in as the victim, open:

```
http://localhost:1337
```

It looks like a harmless "You won a prize!" page. But on load it **auto-submits a hidden
form** that POSTs to `http://localhost:4000/api/maintenance` with a forged request
(`description=Forged by attacker via CSRF`), targeting a hidden iframe so you see nothing.

Now go back to the app tab and **refresh the Maintenance page**. A request you never made —
`Forged by attacker via CSRF` for room `Z9-666` — is now filed **in your name**. The server
could not tell it apart from a real click.

> Want to watch it happen? Open DevTools → **Network** on the attacker page before it loads,
> and you will see the cross-site `POST` to `/api/maintenance` return `201`, with your
> `token` cookie attached under **Request Headers → Cookie**.

---

## 4. Spring the DoS flood

Still on `http://localhost:1337`, click **"Claim my prize"**. The page fires **hundreds of
`fetch` requests** at `http://localhost:4000/api/maintenance` straight from the victim's
browser.

Open DevTools → **Network** and watch: every request returns `200` and is served in full.
There is nothing stopping one client (or a crowd of victims lured to this page) from
hammering the API until it falls over. **No request is ever refused.**

---

## 5. Why it works (the vulnerable code path)

**CSRF**

1. **Auth is a cookie the browser sends for you** — `server/src/middleware/auth.js` reads the
   JWT from `req.cookies.token`. The victim's browser attaches it to the attacker's forged
   request automatically; the server cannot tell the difference between that and a real click.
2. **The write trusts the cookie alone** — `server/src/routes/maintenance.js` guards `POST /`
   with only `requireAuth`. There is **no proof the request came from our own app**: no
   anti-CSRF token.
3. **The body is a plain form** — `server/src/app.js` parses `urlencoded` bodies, so a bare
   HTML `<form>` POST (which needs no JavaScript and triggers no CORS preflight) is enough.
4. **CORS does not save you.** CORS only blocks the attacker from *reading* the response; the
   browser still *sends* the request and the server still *acts on it*. CSRF is about the
   write succeeding, not about reading the reply.

> ### Why `SameSite` doesn't save you here
> The auth cookie is `SameSite=Lax`. You might expect that to block a cross-site POST — and
> across true different sites (`evil.com` → `yourbank.com`) it largely would. But the attacker
> page (`localhost:1337`) and the API (`localhost:4000`) are the **same site**: the port is not
> part of a site's identity, only the registrable domain is. So the cookie is sent. This is a
> deliberate lesson: **`SameSite` is a useful layer but not a substitute for a real anti-CSRF
> token.**

**DoS**

5. **No rate limiting** — `server/src/routes/maintenance.js` applies no limiter, so
   `maintenanceController.getAllRequests` runs for *every* request, no matter how many arrive
   from one client in how short a time. Each one hits the database.

The fixes: require a secret, per-session **CSRF token** on every state-changing request (a
value the attacker's site cannot read or guess), and **rate-limit** the feature so a flood is
refused with `429`. The solution project does this with the `csrf-csrf` and
`express-rate-limit` packages.

## 6. Running the tests locally

A test suite ships with the project. Run it from the **project root**:

```bash
npm install     # first time only
npm test
```

What to expect **in this vulnerable project**:

- The tests describe the **secure** behavior the feature *should* have: a forged request with
  no CSRF token is rejected (server), a flood is throttled to `429` (server), and the client
  attaches a CSRF token to mutating requests (client).
- So here they are **expected to FAIL** (the suite is red). That red result is the starting
  point — your job is to make them green by adding CSRF protection and rate limiting. The
  solution project shows them all passing.

Notes:

- The server tests spin up an **in-memory MongoDB** via `mongodb-memory-server`. The first run
  downloads a small `mongod` binary, so you need **internet access the first time** (cached after).
- You need **Node.js 18+ (20 recommended)**.
- The same `npm test` works on **Windows, macOS, and Linux**.
